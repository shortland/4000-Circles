# 4000 Circles
A really awesome jQuery/CSS animation!

<b>DEMO: http://ilankleiman.com/projects/circles/index.html</b>

A must watch/see!

4,000 circle \<div\>s are written using javascript (loop).<br/>
Each set (4) circles are appended to the corners of the page.<br/>
A random color, and random size are given to the circles<br/>
They are then moved to a random position within the window.<br/>

Doesn't run all that well on mobile devices.<br/>
(You can decrease the time between each circle spawning, which would help)

The majority of the code is JavaScript / jQuery. (I tried very hard to make it as neat as possible) <br/>
There are 3 variables at the top of the <b>script.js</b> They are there for you to toggle & mess around with! Enjoy!
